# Overview

The AvePoint Graph API is a robust suite of tools designed to streamline integration and enhance functionality for managing your digital collaboration environment. It allows developers to interact programmatically with AvePoint's solutions, facilitating automation, data integration, and enhanced operational capabilities.

The API provides advanced features to optimize integration and security:

- Authentication methods: Supports client secret and certificate authentication for secure and efficient access control. This flexibility allows developers to choose the most suitable authentication method for their needs.
- Unified endpoint: The API can be accessed via a unified endpoint format `https://graph-{dc}.avepointonlineservices.com`. Note that the endpoint differs based upon the data center you want to access. For details, refer to [Endpoints Upon Data Centers](#endpoints-upon-data-center).

  > [!NOTE]
  > For users of the Elements API, there is an added convenience. The Elements API supports a single endpoint (`https://graph.avepointonlineservices.com`), meaning you do not need to adjust the endpoint based on the data center. This can simplify your integration process and reduce configuration overhead.
  >
- Comprehensive functionality: Enables seamless interaction with AvePoint services, supporting tasks like data management, reporting, and configuration.
- Scalability and performance: Designed to handle large-scale operations, ensuring reliability and speed in various enterprise scenarios.
- Security measures - Authentication, TLS, and Client secrets:
    - OAuth 2.0 ensures granular, auditable access control.
    - TLS 1.2/1.3 guarantees modern cryptographic protection for data in transit.  
    - Strict client secret rules and certificate requirements mitigate credential theft and brute-force attacks.
  
  By adhering to these protocols, organizations use enterprise-grade security while accessing Graph API, ensuring data integrity and regulatory compliance. For more details, refer to [Security Measures](#security-measures).

## Legacy API

The legacy API offers essential capabilities but is slated for deprecation:

- Functionalities:

  - Retrieve audit records for compliance and monitoring.
  - Import objects into AvePoint Online Services for streamlined data management.
  - Register partner customers to facilitate partner integrations.
  - Access Cloud Backup for Microsoft 365 job information for backup management.
- **Deprecation Notice**: This API has been deprecated after the December 2024 release. Transitioning to the current API is highly recommended to ensure continued support and access to the latest features.
- Documentation: For additional details on the legacy API, refer to [AvePoint Online Services Web API Help](https://avepointcdn.azureedge.net/assets/webhelp/avepoint-online-services-api/index.htm).

### Security Measures

- Authentication Method (OAuth 2.0)  
  
  AvePoint Graph API exclusively uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication and authorization. This industry-standard framework ensures secure delegated access to resources. Applications must authenticate via the app registered through AOS App registration to obtain OAuth 2.0 access tokens, which grant scoped permissions for interacting with Graph API endpoints. This process prevents unauthorized access by validating identities and enforcing least-privilege principles.

- TLS Requirements: TLS 1.2/1.3

  All connections to AvePoint Graph API endpoints must use Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3. Earlier versions (TLS 1.0/1.1) are explicitly disabled and non-compliant. This ensures end-to-end encryption for data in transit, protecting against eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Applications failing to negotiate TLS 1.2+ connections will be blocked.

- Certificates and Client Secret Specifications
  
  - AvePoint recommends that you set an expiration for the secrets of one year for the app registration, and the secrets are hashed using SHA-256 before storing to AvePoint's secure backend system.

  - Certificate-based authentication

      - For enhanced security, use X.509 certificate instead of client secretes.  
      - The certificate must contain a public key, and you must have access to the corresponding private key.
      - The "Key Usage" extension of the certificate must be marked for Digital Signature.
