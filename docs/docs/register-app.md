# Register an App for API Access

To register an app for the AvePoint Graph API, follow these steps:

1. Access AvePoint Online Services  
   - Sign into AvePoint Online Services with your account. For details, refer to [Sign into AvePoint Online Services](https://cdn.avepoint.com/assets/webhelp/avepoint-online-services/index.htm#!Documents/signintoavepointonlineservices.htm).
2. Navigate to **Administration** > **App registrations**.
3. Register a New App with Required Permissions:  
   1. Click **Create** on the **App registrations** page.  
   2. On the **Create app registration** page, enter a name for the app.  
   3. Click **Add service and permission**.  
   4. In the **Add service and permission** pane, select the services and corresponding permissions that you need to grant to this app, and then click **Add**. 
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > For the services and permissions that you can grant to the app for using Graph API, refer to [Services and Permissions](#services-and-permissions).
4. Use a certificate or client secret as the app credentials. Credentials enable application to identify themselves to the authentication service when receiving tokens at a web addressable location (using an HTTPS schema). For a higher level of assurance, we recommend using a certificate. Follow the instructions below to configure credentials:  
     - The certificate serves as credentials that allow your application to authenticate itself, requiring no interaction from a user at runtime. Refer to [Prepare a Certificate for the Custom Azure App](https://cdn.avepoint.com/assets/webhelp/avepoint-online-services/index.htm#!Documents/prepareacertificateforthecustomazureapp.htm) section in AvePoint Online Services user guide to prepare a certificate.  
     - If you choose to use the client secret, you can generate a client secret effective within 1 year, 2 years, or 3 years. Client secret values cannot be entirely shown once they are saved.  
5. Obtain Application (Client) ID  
   - After you have created the app registration, you can click the Copy button to copy the **Application (client) ID** value which will be used to get an access token in the next step.  
6. Get access token: Based on the credentials of your app registration, refer to the following instructions to get an access token:  
   - Use [Client Secret](#client-secret): You need to send a POST request with the client ID, client secret, scope, and grant type.  See the request and response samples in the linked section.
   - Use [Certificate](#certificate). You need to generate a JWT signed with your certificate and send a POST request with the client ID, client assertion (the signed JWT), scope, and grant type. See the DotNet example in the linked section.  
7. Use the access token to call an API. For example, you can use the GET request to retrieve the audit records within a specific time range using the access token:

    ```json
    GET https://graph-us.avepointonlineservices.com/aos/audit?startTime=2023-03-01T08:00:00Z&endTime=2023-03-02T08:00:00Z
    Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
    ```

1. **Set the Access Token URL**  
   Choose the URL based on your organization's AvePoint environment:

   | AOS Environment             | Access Token URL                                                |
   | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Commercial       | `https://identity.avepointonlineservices.com/connect/token`     |
   | U.S. Government  | `https://identity-gov.avepointonlineservices.com/connect/token` |
   | AOS2 | `https://identity-aos2.avepointonlineservices.com/connect/token`|
   | FedRAMP Cloud (Project Hosts)| `https://identity.online15.net/connect/token`|

2. **Set the Header**  
   - `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

3. **Set the Request Body Parameters**  
   - `client_id` – Copy the Application (Client) ID from the app registration.
   - `client_secret` – Copy the saved Client Secret from the app registration.
   - `scope` – Set the scope, which is the assigned permission.
   - `grant_type` – Set to `client_credentials`.
      
    **Request sample for getting access token by client secret:**  
    
    ```json  
    POST https://identity.avepointonlineservices.com/connect/token
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

 ## Certificate  

To obtain an access token using a certificate in an app registration, follow the instructions below:  

1. Ensure .NET 6 or later is installed.  
2. Create a new project. Use the following command to create a new project and add the required package.  

        dotnet new console -o AosPublicApiTokenSample --framework net6.0 
        cd ./AosPublicApiTokenSample
        dotnet add package System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt --version 6.30.1
3. Modify `Program.cs`. Open the `AosPublicApiTokenSample` folder and find the `Program.cs` file. Replace the file content with the following code:  

    ```json
    using System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt;
    using System.Net.Http.Json;
    using System.Security.Claims;
    using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;
    using System.Text.Json.Serialization;
    using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens;

    // Set your app registration information and certificate here
    const string CLIENT_ID = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"; // Application (Client) ID
    const string SCOPES = "YOUR_SCOPE"; // Permission, e.g., "audit.read.all"
    const string CERTIFICATE_PATH = "YOUR_CERTIFICATE_PATH"; // Path to .pfx or .pem file
    const string CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD = "YOUR_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD";

    const string IDENTITY_SERVICE_URI = "https://identity.avepointonlineservices.com/connect/token";
    const string AUDIENCE = "https://identity.avepointonlineservices.com/connect/token";

    var clientAssertionValue = GenerateClientAssertion();
    var token = await GetToken(clientAssertionValue);

    PrintToken(token);

    static string GenerateClientAssertion()
    {
        var certificate = new X509Certificate2(CERTIFICATE_PATH, CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD);
        var signingCredentials = new X509SigningCredentials(certificate);

        var claims = new List<Claim>()
        {
            new Claim("jti", Guid.NewGuid().ToString()),
            new Claim("sub", CLIENT_ID)
        };

        var jwtSecurityToken = new JwtSecurityToken(
            CLIENT_ID,
            AUDIENCE,
            claims,
            DateTime.Now,
            DateTime.Now.AddHours(1),
            signingCredentials);

        var clientAssertionValue = new JwtSecurityTokenHandler().WriteToken(jwtSecurityToken);
        return clientAssertionValue;
    }

    static async Task<AosTokenResponse?> GetToken(string clientAssertionValue)
    {
        var requestContent = new FormUrlEncodedContent(new Dictionary<string, string>
        {
            {"grant_type", "client_credentials"},
            {"client_assertion_type", "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer"},
            {"client_assertion", clientAssertionValue},
            {"scope", SCOPES},
        });

        try
        {
            var client = new HttpClient();
            var response = await client.PostAsync(IDENTITY_SERVICE_URI, requestContent);

            if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
            {
                var token = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<AosTokenResponse>();
                return token;
            }
            else
            {
                throw new Exception($"Status code: {response.StatusCode}, Raw content: {await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync()}");
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Get token failed: {ex}");
            return null;
        }
    }

    static void PrintToken(AosTokenResponse? token)
    {
        if (token == null)
        {
            return;
        }

        Console.WriteLine("[Access Token]");
        Console.WriteLine(token.AccessToken);
        Console.WriteLine("[Scope]");
        Console.WriteLine(token.Scope);
    }

    class AosTokenResponse
    {
        [JsonPropertyName("access_token")]
        public string? AccessToken { get; set; }

        [JsonPropertyName("expires_in")]
        public int ExpiresIn { get; set; }

        [JsonPropertyName("token_type")]
        public string? TokenType { get; set; }

        [JsonPropertyName("scope")]
        public string? Scope { get; set; }
    }
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Adjust the `IDENTITY_SERVICE_URI` based on your AvePoint Online Services environment.  
    >
    > |AOS Environment| Identity Services URL|
    > |---|---|
    > |Commercial | `https://identity.avepointonlineservices.com/connect/token`|
    > |U.S. Government |`https://identity-gov.avepointonlineservices.com/connect/token`|
    > | AOS2 | `https://identity-aos2.avepointonlineservices.com/connect/token`|
    > | FedRAMP Cloud (Project Hosts)| `https://identity.online15.net/connect/token`|

4. Execute the following command to run the project.  
   `dotnet run`
5. Access token output. The console will display:  

    ```json
    [Access Token]
    eyJhbGc...
    [Scope]
    audit.read.all
    ```
